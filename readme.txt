== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I change the size of my MP3 widget? =

You can set 'height' and 'width' parameters to resize your widget. For e.g., to get a 250x250 widget, I would do something like this:<br/><br/>
`[mp3 width="250" height="250"]` <br/><br/>
Valid combinations of Width x Height are: 250 x 250, 336 x 280, 120 x 300, 160 x 300, 125 x 125, 120 x 90, 234 x 60
The default width is 336 x 280
